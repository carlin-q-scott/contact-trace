# Contact Trace
The purpose of this project is to trace contact between people in order to notify them if someone they've recently come into contact may have had the COVID-19 virus. This will allow them to self-quarentine and request a test to check if they have the virus or not.

This system needs to be entirely transparent and maximize privacy in order to gain widespread adoption. Hence it is entirely open source and will rely on anonymous data.

For more information, please see the wiki, which is a living document maintained by the community to ensure all voices are heard, and all needs are addressed.
